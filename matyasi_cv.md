- Dissertation topic: Spinoza's metaphysics of the finite: composition, essence, modality
- Dissertation committee: Karolina Hübner (supervisor), Nick Stang, Marleen Rozemond
- Dissertation abstract: 

> My dissertation is about Spinoza's metaphysics of ordinary objects, organisms, and persons. I focus on three topics: mereological composition, essence and universals, and the nature of contingency. First I argue that Spinoza is an anti-realist about composition because he is a perspectivalist. That is, for Spinoza, expressions such as '*x* is a part of *y*' or '*x* is a whole composed of some *y*s' convey abstract judgments from a limited perspective. Then I turn to Spinoza's famous *conatus doctrine* which says that the actual essence of an individual is their striving for survival. I argue that it is important for Spinoza that this striving belongs to a natural kind: for example, humans and horses are essentially different. I show that the scope of Spinoza's alleged nominalist commitments don't rule out the existence of a limited set of properties---i.e., universals *in the things* as opposed to Platonic forms. Lastly, I argue that Spinoza holds *modal compatibilism*, the view that some things are both necessary and contingent. I argue that this interpretation allows us to clarify Spinoza's necessitarianism. Second, this reading leads to a new take on answering the acosmist critique of Spinoza.

I am a frequent contributor to the [*Kiskáté*](http://www.muut.hu/archivum/category/kiskate) column in the Hungarian journal *Műút*. In *Kiskáté* we write short introductions explaining philosophical debates---especially ones that have little or no discussion available in Hungarian---on the occasion of discussing a recent major publication.

So far I wrote pieces on the following:

- [Michael O. Hardimon: Rethinking Race](http://www.muut.hu/archivum/34422)
- [Timothy Williamson: Modal Logic as Metaphysics](http://www.muut.hu/archivum/12867)

- [Diana Raffman: Unruly Words](http://www.muut.hu/archivum/25250)

Our essays (until 2017) are also published as a collection:
